# Databricks Pipeline sample

This is a sample project to demonstrate how to use Databricks Pipeline using jobs.
First a websprapping was made from the salaries of the [MLS](https://mlsplayers.org/resources/salary-guide).

Then a pipeline was created to process the data and save it in a database using data bricks Notebooks.
The data is stored in the Lakehouse using Hive Metastore.

Finally, the data was used to create a dashboard using Tableau.

The video with the DEMO can be found [here](https://youtu.be/XEviQP92PCk).


The final product is a Tableau Dashboard with some insights about the data:
